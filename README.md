# NLP-Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
Implementation of a Bi-GRU recurrent neural network in Pytorch for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) in association with BERT. Project developed for Natural Language Processing course held by professor R. Navigli (Sapienza University of Rome).
Many other machine learning techinques are applied. For more information please check the pdf of the report.

## Notice
Unfortunately I am not allowed to share the dataset thereby you cannot download and run the code.
